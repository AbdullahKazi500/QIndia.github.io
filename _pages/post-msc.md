Often, between completing their Masters degree and joining a PhD program, people look for _interim research positions_ to sharpen their research interests, gain more exposure, enhance their profile, and better understand whether a career in academia suits them. Below we list some institutions that offer such _funded_ programs. Note that if you are okay with working without any fellowship, you can always email any faculty member at a research institute and request them for a position (in case you are not very confident about what to write in the email, feel free to check out [our related posts](/drafting/)). 

_Apart from these, institutes often invite people to work on funded projects for 1-2 years as Graduate Trainees or Junior Research Fellows (JRFs); these can be looked up on websites like [researchersjob](https://researchersjob.com/) or [fresherslive](https://www.fresherslive.com/search-jobs/msc)._
