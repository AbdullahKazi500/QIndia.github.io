## What is this about?

Physics education in undergraduate institutes is often inadequate in preparing students for research. Lack of exposure to actual methods and cutting-edge topics makes it harder for the students to jump into doctoral work. Summer projects, summer schools, workshops, and online courses bridge this gap to a great extent, and this page intends to make this process easier by providing exhaustive information regarding these avenues.

## What can you find here?

* We will provide regular and up-to-date information regarding summer/winter projects and internships on physics and other related fields, at various institutes in India.
* We will provide resources that will guide interested students in applying for these programs. These include help in writing up statements of purpose, approaching professors and creating a curriculum vitae.
* We also intend, at some point, to create a database of scientists categorised into topics; students will be able to search through the topics in order to find research groups that match their interests.
