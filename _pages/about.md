Projectyl is a website designed to help pre-PhD students ease into doctoral work by providing information that can help them get some previous exposure to research. Physics education in undergraduate institutes is often inadequate in preparing students for research, mostly due to the lack of exposure to actual methods and cutting-edge topics. Summer projects, summer schools, workshops, and online courses can, we believe, bridge this gap to some extent, and this website intends to make this process easier by providing exhaustive information regarding these avenues.

# What can you find here?

- We will provide regular and up-to-date information regarding summer/winter projects and internships on physics and other related fields, at various institutes in India.
- We will provide resources that will guide interested students in applying for these programs. These include help in writing up statements of purpose, approaching professors and creating a curriculum vitae.
- We also intend, at some point, to create a database of scientists categorised into topics; students will be able to search through the topics in order to find research groups that match their interests.
