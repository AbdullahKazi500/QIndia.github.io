## What is Projectyl?

Projectyl is a website that hosts information and notifications regarding **summer internships, workshops, summer schools**, and other similar activities in the world of physics in India. This information is provided with the goal of making this available to **pre-PhD students studying in colleges**, particularly those who will pursue doctoral studies. Our hope is that by making use of these avenues, students will obtain some **exposure to research**, and feel more confident in facing tougher challenges during their PhD.

## Why did we start this?

Physics education in undergraduate institutes is often **inadequate** in preparing students for research. This is mostly because, most often, students **aren't exposed to actual methods** and cutting-edge research topics, leaving them without any idea of what actual research is about. Summer projects, summer schools, workshops, and online courses can, we believe, **bridge this gap** to some extent, by providing hands-on experience to students, as well providing windows into highly specialised areas of research. This website intends to **make this process easier** by providing exhaustive information regarding these avenues.

## What can you find here?

- We provide **regular and up-to-date information** regarding summer/winter projects and internships on physics and other related fields as well as summer schools and workshops, at various institutes in India. From time to time, we also notify about international programmes.

[Schools](/schools/){: .btn .btn--info }
[International](/inter/){: .btn .btn--info }

- For those interested, we have also compiled a list of (i) **year-round internships** that accept applications at any time during the year, and (ii) **long-term internships** (6 months - 1 year) for people who have completed their master's. We also have a list of programmes dedicated towards high school students.

- We have some resources that will guide interested students in **applying for these programs**. These include help in writing up statements of purpose, approaching professors and creating a curriculum vitae.

- We have also begun creating a **database of scientists** grouped into topics. This is being done so that if a student is unable to find a suitable internship following official channels, they can go through the database and get in touch with research groups that **match their interests**.
