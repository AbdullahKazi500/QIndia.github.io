Here are some upcoming winter schools, both domestic and international. Some have upcoming deadlines, check them out soon.

### Statistical physics of complex systems - ICTS

- [**Link**](https://icts.res.in/discussion-meeting/SPCS2022)
- **Institute**: ICTS, Bangalore
- **Description**: This discussion meeting aims to discuss some of the exciting recent developments in equilibrium and nonequilibrium statistical physics. This will include areas such as self-organized criticality, exactly solvable models, interfacial growth, out-of equilibrium dynamics and active matter. 
- **Deadline**: 15 September 2022
- **Date of program**: 19 December to 23 December 2022

### ICTP-KIAS School on Statistical Physics for Life Sciences

- [**Link**](https://indico.ictp.it/event/9836/)
- **Description**:  The school aims at providing unique opportunities for (junior) scientists in the Asia Pacific region to learn modern statistical physics and its applications to quantitative life science, machine learning, and data science. 
- **Deadline**: 30 September 2022
- **Dates**: 31 Oct - 8 Nov 2022

### Quantum Africa (QA) Conference Series

- [**Link**](https://qa.eaifr.org/?page_id=739)
- **Description**: This will be the sixth (6th) Quantum Africa (QA) conference and will be focused on Quantum Information Processing (this includes quantum computing, quantum communication, quantum cryptography, quantum simulations), together with all its algorithmic and hardware aspects.
- **Dates**: 12-16 September 2022

### Hands-on training of computational fluid dynamics - IIT Mandi

- [**Link**](https://research.iitmandi.ac.in/cfd_hpkvn/)
- **Deadline**: 25th September 2022
- **Description**: This course will provide an introduction to the theoretical fundamentals as well as to the use of commercial and opensource CFD codes to analyze flow and heat transfer in problems of practical engineering interest. Participants will be trained to preprocess raw geometric data, mesh it and then develop a CFD model.
- **Dates**: 01 Nov to 19 Nov 2022
