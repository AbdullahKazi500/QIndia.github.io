## What is this about?

Education in undergraduate institutes is usually inadequate in preparing students for research. There is almost no exposure to actual research methods or cutting-edge topics, making it harder for the students to jump into research. Summer projects, summer schools, workshops, and online courses bridge this gap to a great extent, and this website intends to make this process easier by providing exhaustive information regarding these methods.

## What should you expect?

-We will provide regular and up-to-date information regarding summer projects and internships that are available in various institutes in India.
-We will provide resources that will help interested students while applying for these positions.
-We will maintain list of supplementary material that we feel might help undergraduate students in honing their numerical or programming skills.
