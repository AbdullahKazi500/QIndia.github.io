# Website for Projectyl

<img align="left" src="assets/images/general/logo.png" width="90">

This is the repository for the [Projectyl website](https://projectyl.github.io/). It uses the [minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) Jekyll theme. Most of the heavy-lifting has already been done by the theme. Make sure to check out our [website](https://projectyl.github.io/) for more information. Feel free to reach out to us with questions or suggestions via [email](mailto:projectylindia@gmail.com) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/projectyl.in).

## What is Projectyl?

Physics education in undergraduate institutes is often inadequate in preparing students for research. Lack of exposure to actual methods and cutting-edge topics makes it harder for the students to jump into doctoral work. Summer projects, summer schools, workshops, and online courses bridge this gap to a great extent. [Projectyl](https://projectyl.github.io) is an endeavour that intends to make this process easier by providing exhaustive information regarding these avenues.

## What can you find here?

- We will provide regular and up-to-date information regarding summer/winter projects and internships on physics and other related fields, at various institutes in India.

- We will provide resources that will guide interested students in applying for these programs. These include help in writing up statements of purpose, approaching professors and creating a curriculum vitae.

- We also intend, at some point, to create a database of scientists categorised into topics; students will be able to search through the topics in order to find research groups that match their interests.
