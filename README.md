# Website for Projectyl

This is the repository for the [Projectyl website](https://projectyl.github.io/). It uses the [minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) Jekyll theme. Most of the heavy-lifting has already been done by the theme. Make sure to check out our [website](https://projectyl.github.io/) for more information. Feel free to reach out to us with questions or suggestions via [email](mailto:projectylindia@gmail.com) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/projectyl.in).
