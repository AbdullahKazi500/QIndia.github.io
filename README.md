# Website for Projectyl

<img align="left" src="assets/images/general/logo.png" width="90">

This is the repository for the [Projectyl website](https://projectyl.github.io/). It uses the [minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) Jekyll theme. Most of the heavy-lifting has already been done by the theme. Make sure to check out our [website](https://projectyl.github.io/) for more information. Feel free to reach out to us with questions or suggestions via [email](mailto:projectylindia@gmail.com) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/projectyl.in).

## What is Projectyl?

Physics education in undergraduate institutes is often inadequate in preparing students for research. Lack of exposure to actual methods and cutting-edge topics makes it harder for the students to jump into doctoral work. Summer projects, summer schools, workshops, and online courses bridge this gap to a great extent. [Projectyl](https://projectyl.github.io) is an endeavour that intends to make this process easier by providing exhaustive information regarding these avenues.

## What can you find here?

- We will provide regular and up-to-date information regarding summer/winter projects and internships on physics and other related fields, at various institutes in India.

- We will provide resources that will guide interested students in applying for these programs. These include help in writing up statements of purpose, approaching professors and creating a curriculum vitae.

- We also intend, at some point, to create a database of scientists categorised into topics; students will be able to search through the topics in order to find research groups that match their interests.

## Todo

- [ ] Create a post on SOP writing
- [ ] Create a post on CV writing
- [ ] Create a post on various sources of fellowship
- [ ] Create a post that lays out the entire procedure of applying for internships, starting from the time-frames, various steps, the finer details and how to search for them
- [ ] Make interview-type content where people that have participated in internships share their experience
- [x] Create a post that lays out the ways in which high school students can get exposure to advanced  science and research
- [ ] Create a curated database of scientists who are prepared to undertake project students
- [ ] Separate internships into seasonal (summer/winter) and throughout-the-year types
- [ ] Add ability to filter database according to institution
- [x] Improve the appearance of tables in the database
- [x] Automate the generation of pdf from internship lists
- [ ] Automate looking up webpages to see if new program announcements are available 
- [ ] Expand the list of summer workshops and summer schools by incorporating the remaining items from the google sheet
- [ ] Create separate post/page for international internships

Blog and tutorial series focused on helping Quantum beginners find their footing. There are many resources out there for people to learn about quantum computing. However we would like to create a place where absolute beginners can start from, like a “start here” section that then takes them step-by-step through the process of understanding the minimum before exploring the world of quantum computing for themselves. The content will be a combination of original creations by the team and links to specific sections of already existing content
